While the focus of this site is open source software, there are other licenses more appropriate for projects that aren't code, e.g. [CC0](/licenses/cc0-1.0/) and the [Open Font License](/licenses/ofl-1.1/).

If your project contains a mix of software and content, you can include multiple licenses, as long as you are explicit about which license applies to what segments of the project.  See [the license disclaimer for this site](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com#license) as an example.
