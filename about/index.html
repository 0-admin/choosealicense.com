      <h1>What&#8217;s this about?</h1>
      <p>
        We want to help developers choose a license for their source code.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you already know what you&#8217;re doing and have a license you prefer to use, that&#8217;s great! We&#8217;re not here to change your mind. But if you are bewildered by the large number of OSS license choices, maybe we can help.
      </p>

      <h2>Not comprehensive</h2>
      <p>
        This site is not a comprehensive directory of open source licenses. If you&#8217;re looking for a comprehensive list, we recommend the <a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> website.
      </p>
      <p>
        We think there are too many options which adds to the confusion. On the homepage, we break it down to just three licenses. For the vast majority of projects, these are probably the only three you need to choose from. We also highlight a few other licenses to consider for those with specific needs.

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        We are not lawyers. Well most of us anyways. It is not the goal of this site to provide legal advice. The goal of this site is to provide information on popular open source license choices to provide a starting point for you to make an informed choice. If possible, you should always consult a legal expert before adopting a license for your code.
