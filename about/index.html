      <h1>What&#8217;s this about?</h1>
      <p>
        We want to help developers choose a license for their source code.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you already know what you&#8217;re doing and have a license you prefer to use, that&#8217;s great! We&#8217;re not here to change your mind. But if you are bewildered by the large number of OSS license choices, maybe we can help.
      </p>

      <h2>Not comprehensive</h2>
      <p>
        This site is not a comprehensive directory of open source licenses. If you&#8217;re looking for a comprehensive list, we recommend the <a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> website.
      </p>
      <p>
        We think there are too many options, which adds to the confusion. On the homepage, we break it down into just three licenses. For the vast majority of projects, these are probably the only three you will need to choose from. Just in case you have specific needs not covered by those three, we also highlight a few other licenses to consider.

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        We are not lawyers. Well most of us anyways. It is not the goal of this site to provide legal advice. The goal of this site is to provide a starting point to help you make an informed choice by providing information on popular open source licenses. If you have any questions regarding the right license for your code or any other legal issues relating to it, it&#8217;s always best to consult with a professional.
