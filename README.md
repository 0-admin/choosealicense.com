# Choose a License Web Site

Like a Choose Your Own Adventure site, but only much less interesting.

# Intro

A lot of repositories on GitHub.com don't have a license. GitHub could slap on 
a license chooser, but if you don't know anything about licenses, how are you 
supposed to make an informed decision.

ChooseALicense.com is designed to help people make an informed decision about 
licenses. 

# Immediate Goals

* Politics Free - Let's just not get into it.
* Well designed, but that goes without saying.
* The homepage should have just enough to help 99% of folks make a decision.
* For the 1%, the site will contain a license chooser similar to 
the [creative commons license chooser](http://creativecommons.org/choose/)

# Design

I think v1 of the site could be a completely static JavaScript site. No need 
for a back end until we actually need it.

# Community

We plan to build out the skeleton of the site privately first, but then open 
it up to accept contributions.

Phil will look into whether various open source foundations and lawyers would 
be interested in being involved. Probably makes good sense to have a lawyer 
review the content before we post it live.
