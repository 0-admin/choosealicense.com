      <h3><a href="licenses/mit">I'm interested in simplicity and permissiveness.</a></h3>
      <p>
        The <a href="licenses/mit">MIT License</a> is a permissive license that is short and to the point. It doesn't include any warranties and lets people do anything they want with your code (with attribution back to you). 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>jQuery</strong> and <strong>Rails</strong> use the MIT License.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='patents'>
      <a href="licenses/apache"><img height='72' src='images/lightbulb@2x.png' width='43'></a>
      <h3><a href="licenses/apache">I’m concerned about patents.</a></h3>
      <p>
        The <a href="licenses/apache/">Apache License</a> is a permissive license similar to the MIT License, but also contains a patent license for any code that infringes on a contributor’s patents.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Apache</strong>, <strong>SVN</strong>, and <strong>NuGet</strong> use the Apache License.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='reciprocity'>
      <!--
      TODO: We might need a GPL landing page here so we're not making any political statements
      -->
      <a href="licenses/gpl-v2"><img height='69' src='images/circular@2x.png' width='72'></a>
      <h3><a href="licenses/gpl.html">I care about reciprocity.</a></h3>
      <p>
        The GPL (<a href="licenses/gpl-v2">V2</a> or <a href="licenses/gpl-v3">V3</a>) isn't a permissive license, meaning that it requires that folks who modify your code also license their changes under the GPL. V3 is similar to V2, but adds a restriction restricting use in hardware that forbids software alterations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Linux</strong> and <strong>Git</strong> use the GPL.
