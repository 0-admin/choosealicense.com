        So you want to choose an OSS license.
        <strong>Now what?</strong>
      </h1>

      <p>
        <strong>This doesn't need to be scary.</strong> 
        We compiled a list of three licenses that address what most projects need. 
        You can pick on of these and be on your way, or click the links to dig deeper 
        into picking a license that meets your unique needs.

      <h2>
        <strong>Ready? Which of the following describes you?</strong>
        <h3 class="big-intro-link">Do whatever with my code</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#mit">The MIT license</a> is a permissive license that is short and to the point. 
          It lets people do anything with your code with two main stipulations: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Include proper attribution</li>
            <li>- The code is provided without warranty of any kind</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>

          <strong class="projects">Projects that use this: jQuery, Rails</strong>

      <h2>
        <h3 class="big-intro-link">I&#8217;m concerned about patents</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#mit">The Apache license</a> is a permissive license similar to the MIT License, 
          but it provides a patent license for any code that infringes on a contributor&#8217;s patents. 
        </p>

      <h2>
        <h3 class="big-intro-link">You care about reciprocity</h3>
        <p>
          The GPL (<a href="#v2">v2</a> or <a href="#v3">v3</a>) requires that folks who modify your 
          code also license their changes under the GPL. V3 is similar to v2, but adds a restriction 
          that doesn&#8217;st allow using the software in hardware that doesn&#8217;t allow modifying 
          the software.
